\title{Boundary matrix}
\usage{
boundary_matrix(
  x,
  dims = "all",
  labeled = c("none", "columns", "both"),
  field = c("mod2", "integer", "real")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{list of simplices, simplex tree, or a filtration.}

\item{labeled}{whether to add simplex labels to the corresponding matrices.}

\item{field}{intended}

\item{dim}{dimension of boundary matrix desired}
}
\description{
Constructs filtration boundary matrices
}
\details{
This function computes and returns the elementary chains associated with a filtered simplicial complex.
The filtration is expected to be given as list of a simplices.
